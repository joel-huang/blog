When future humans look back at the development of AI, some moments will
stand out as historic.

They'll argue about which moment was more legendary:
the invention of backpropagation! No, it's AlexNet ushering in deep learning.
Who could forget *Transformers is All You Need*? Surely it must be AlphaGo
beating Lee Sedol. Midjourney's #1 discord server. ChatGPT.

But a few fleeting moments - a little less well acknowledged,
a whole lot less significant - will dominate the memories of a few
blessed to have experienced their sheer weirdness.

The short-lived era of DALL·E Mini, later rechristened as Craiyon, is such
a moment. A fugitive golden hour when AI-generated art existed in a beautiful
state of grotesqueness, democratized access, and unbridled experimentation.

<Timeline />

## Just good enough to slap a UI on

DALL·E Mini was an unexpected protagonist in the AI "art" revolution, not
because it was good, but because it was first, free, and functional.

While more sophisticated models remained behind institutional (fire)walls
amidst a period of "too dangerous to release" crisis narratives, artist
Boris Dayma decided to toss a simple text box and a little orange button
on a website, inviting anyone with an internet connection and a minute to
participate in his grand little experiment. Sam Altman would do well to
take a leaf out of Boris's book.

The results were gloriously absurd. Users delighted in prompting the system with
juicy scenarios, waiting a few minutes each time to roll 9 images in its signature
3x3 grid:

DALL·E Mini's tendency to produce warped faces, melted hands, and inexplicable artifacts
became features rather than bugs, birthing a cursed aesthetic vocabulary I and many
came to love. The images were so fucking bad they were good.

## Social experimentation

The imperfections in these early models created space for human understanding, meaning-making,
and meme-making.

People used biases present in the models to make jokes about politicians, fictional characters,
and pop culture. Absurdist stonks dominated this meme exchange (when anything is possible, most
things are absurd). 

Every time someone spent a minute only to end up with gross human hands or faces, pure black images,
or horrifying repeated patterns, they built a small bit of intuition for how these things are made.

People quickly figured out tricks, like saying "unreal engine" to boost realism or exploiting glitch
tokens to peek into the model's latent space. These hacks spread fast, fueling further exploration
and vibrant discourse. It felt sort of like the early days of the internet, or going to college with
a bunch of weirdos (in the best way possible).

## Consciously preserving space for the weird and wonderful

Today's image and video generators are already powering early adopters and the next wave of creators.
Flux 1.1 Pro vs. Midjourney v6.1 dominates the conversation today, and the world is better for it.
Progress and commercialization are inevitable and undeniably valuable, and we see clear paths to
productivity across visually creative domains.

The sun set long ago on DALL·E Mini as a cutting-edge research demo. Yet its imperfections reveal
something more truthful than polish ever could. In the pursuit of faster, better, cheaper - find
beauty in the short-lived spaces between.
