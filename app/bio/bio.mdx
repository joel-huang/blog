## About

I grew up creating.

I spent my younger years making stuff: publishing blog themes, modding games, and
running experimental MMO servers for friends to play games to experience content
they otherwise wouldn't be able to. Those years shaped my understanding of
creation as a tool for expression and connection.

## Career

Academia offered its intellectual allure, but the gap between theory and creation
proved too wide. I returned to my craft with a sharper mind and a mission to build
great things people love.

I now shape AI and product at Bifrost. Our mission it to make it incredibly simple to
create synthetic data for physical AI development. Building these tools isn't just
good business - they're essential for accelerating the next generation of intelligent
systems.
