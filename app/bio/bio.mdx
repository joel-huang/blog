I launch here!

Launching something forces me to make it exist. Making it exist requires me to confront the gap
between my perfect idea and the turd that I first make. Hopefully, it's no longer a turd when you see it.

## About

I grew up making things on the internet: game mods, blog themes, apps, and mini MMO servers for friends.
I kept running into limits and removing them: paywalls, locked content, bad design, and artificial constraints.

In academia, I was intellectually engrossed but hated the disconnect from impact. I needed my work to survive contact
with reality and help real people make progress.

Today I work on AI and product at Bifrost. Our goal is to make building Physical AI less impossible so people can
actually build smart robots that work.
